```
tickers= temp
j=0
for(t in tickers)
{
  j=j+1
  a =get(noquote(t))[,1]
  print(c(t,length(a)))

}

Considering sources which has longest historical price range, based on their number of rows we select the sources having 4000 rows. We create a datasets *Open,High,Low,Close* . For instance Open dataset consists of open prices for all the stock sources having 4000 rows, so on for Close, High and Low.
