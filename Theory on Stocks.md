## What is a Stock ?-Stock,Share,Equity all are same.  

Stock,share,equity all are same.Stock is a share in the ownership of a company.It represents a claim on the company's assets and earnings.As someone acquires more stock,his ownership or stake becomes higher.Stocks can create massive amount of wealth in no time, but they aren't without risk.  
**What is being a shareholder mean?**  
Being a shareholder of a company doesn't mean you have a say in daily running of the business.Holding a share at Microsoft doesn't mean,you can call Bill Gates and share your line of thinking with him.Its the large institutional investors and billionaire who make the decisions.  
The basic idea for small shareholders is not to work and get easy money just investing.Small shareholders are entitled to portion of company's profits and have claim on assets.More the share,larger portion of profit the share holder recieves.Claim on assets is only possible if the company goes bankrupt.  
**Why companies issue stock?- Debt vs. Equity**  
Some point of time every company needs to raise money,to do this company either borrow money or raise it by selling part of the company,which is known as issuing stock.A company has two ways to borrow money, one by taking loan from banks which is know as **debt financing**.The other way by issuing stock which is known as **equity financing**.  
Issuing stock/Equity financing is advantageous for companies since the companies don't need to pay back the money with interest. All that the shareholders get in return for their money is the hope that the shares will someday be worth more than what they paid for them.   
When you buy a *debt* investment such as a bond, you are guaranteed the return of your money (the principal) along with promised interest payments.Whereas in *equity* investment, the risk of the company not being successful just as a small business owner isn't guaranteed a return, neither is a shareholder. Shareholders earn a lot if a company is successful, but they also stand to lose their entire investment if the company isn't successful.  

**Types of Stocks:**  

Two main types of stocks are : **Common Stock** and **Preferred Stock**.  

**Common Stock**: Common stocks form the majority of the stock,it represents ownership and a claim(dividends) on a portion of profit.Common stock yeilds higher return than other investments.This higher return comes at a cost since common stocks entail the most risk. If a company goes bankrupt and liquidates, the common shareholders will not receive money until the creditors,bondholders and preferred shareholders are paid.  
**Preferred Stock**: Preferred stocks represents some degree of ownership in a company, but doesn't come with the same voting rights.Preferred shares are guaranteed a fixed dividend forever.Another advantage is that in the event of liquidation, preferred shareholders are paid off before the common shareholder (but still after debt holders). Preferred stock may also be callable, meaning that the company has the option to purchase the shares from shareholders at anytime for any reason (usually for a premium).  

**Different Classes Of Stocks:**  
Companies customize different classes of stocks, in a way they want to have the voting power to remain in certain groups, hence different classes of shares are given different voting rights.  
When there is more classes of stocks they are designated as *class A and class B*. For instance,Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK), has two classes of stock. The different forms are represented by placing the letter behind the ticker symbol in a form like this: "BRKa, BRKb" or "BRK.A, BRK.B".

## Stock Exchanges: NYSE,NASDAQ  
**New York Stock Exchange(NYSE):** One of the most prestigious stock exchange in the world.Currently NYSE has stocks of huge American Enterprises like : General Electric, McDonald's,Citigroup, Coca-Cola, Gillette and Wal-mart. 
  
**NASDAQ:** Over The Counter(OTC) market, have no central location or floor brokers whatsoever. Trading is done through a computer and telecommunications network of dealers.NASDAQ is the most popular OTC exchange.Nasdaq is home to several big technology companies such as Microsoft,Cisco,Intel, Dell and Oracle. This has resulted in the Nasdaq becoming a serious competitor to the NYSE.

## Important Terms:  
* **Dividend:** A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings decided by the board of directors, to a class of its shareholders.Dividends can be issued as *cash payments, as shares of stock or other property*.  
* **Liquidation:** Liquidation is an event that usually occurs when a company is insolvent, meaning it cannot pay its obligations as and when they come due. The companyâ€™s operations are brought to an end, and its assets are divied up among creditors and shareholders, according to the priority of their claims.
* **IPO(Initial Public Offering):** An initial public offering (IPO) is the first time that the stock of a private company is offered to the public. IPOs are often issued by smaller, younger companies seeking capital to expand, but they can also be done by large privately owned companies looking to become publicly traded.  
* **Absolute Priority:** An absolute priority is a rule that stipulates the order of payment - creditors before shareholders - in the event of liquidation. The absolute priority rule is used in bankruptcies to decide what portion of payment will be received by which participants. Debts to creditors will be paid first and shareholders (partial owners) divide what remains.  
* **Inventory:** Inventory is the raw materials, work-in-process products and finished goods that are considered to be the portion of a business's assets that are ready or will be ready for sale. Inventory represents one of the most important assets of a business because the turnover of inventory represents one of the primary sources of revenue generation and subsequent earnings for the company's shareholders.  
* **Bid:** A bid is an offer made by an investor, a trader or a dealer to buy a security, commodity or currency. It stipulates both the price the potential buyer is willing to pay and the quantity to be purchased at that price. Bid also refers to the price at which a market maker is willing to buy; unlike a retail buyer, a market maker also displays an ask price.
