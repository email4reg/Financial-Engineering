# Fundamentals of Stock Market  

## What is a Stock ?-Stock,Share,Equity all same.  

Stock,share,equity all are same.Stock is a share in the ownership of a company.It represents a claim on the company's assets and earnings.As someone acquires more stock,his ownership or stake becomes higher.Stocks can create massive amount of wealth in no time, but they aren't without risk.  
**What is being a shareholder mean?**  
Being a shareholder of a company doesn't mean you have a say in daily running of the business.Holding a share at Microsoft doesn't mean,you can call Bill Gates and share your line of thinking with him.Its the large institutional investors and billionaire who make the decisions.  
The basic idea for small shareholders is not to work and get easy money just investing.Small shareholders are entitled to portion of company's profits and have claim on assets.More the share,larger portion of profit the share holder recieves.Claim on assets is only possible if the company goes bankrupt.  
**Why companies issue stock?- Debt vs. Equity**  
Some point of time every company needs to raise money,to do this company either borrow money or raise it by selling part of the company,which is known as issuing stock.A company has two ways to borrow money, one by taking loan from banks which is know as **debt financing**.The other way by issuing stock which is known as **equity financing**.  
Issuing stock/Equity financing is advantageous for companies since the companies don't need to pay back the money with interest. All that the shareholders get in return for their money is the hope that the shares will someday be worth more than what they paid for them.   
When you buy a *debt* investment such as a bond, you are guaranteed the return of your money (the principal) along with promised interest payments.Whereas in *equity* investment, the risk of the company not being successful just as a small business owner isn't guaranteed a return, neither is a shareholder. Shareholders earn a lot if a company is successful, but they also stand to lose their entire investment if the company isn't successful.


## Important Terms:  
* **Dividend:** A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings decided by the board of directors, to a class of its shareholders.Dividends can be issued as *cash payments, as shares of stock or other property*.  
* **Liquidation:** Liquidation is an event that usually occurs when a company is insolvent, meaning it cannot pay its obligations as and when they come due. The companyâ€™s operations are brought to an end, and its assets are divied up among creditors and shareholders, according to the priority of their claims.
* **IPO(Initial Public Offering):** An initial public offering (IPO) is the first time that the stock of a private company is offered to the public. IPOs are often issued by smaller, younger companies seeking capital to expand, but they can also be done by large privately owned companies looking to become publicly traded.  
* **Absolute Priority:** An absolute priority is a rule that stipulates the order of payment - creditors before shareholders - in the event of liquidation. The absolute priority rule is used in bankruptcies to decide what portion of payment will be received by which participants. Debts to creditors will be paid first and shareholders (partial owners) divide what remains.
